# Report Generation

## Purpose
After all section checks are complete, generate the EKS Operation Review report.

## Consistency Checks (MANDATORY before writing)

Before writing the report, validate consistency:

1. **Build a master list** of all findings with their ratings from sections 01-10
2. **For each RED item:** confirm it appears in "Critical" (or "Quick Wins" if fixable in < 1 hour)
3. **For each AMBER item:** confirm it appears in "Important" (or "Quick Wins" if fixable in < 1 hour)
4. **For the Executive Summary:** only mention ratings that match the master list — do not call something a "critical gap" if it's AMBER, or omit a RED from the summary
5. **For Prioritized Actions:** every entry must reference the finding ID (e.g., "4.1 — Control Plane Logging")
6. **One row per finding in Prioritized Actions** — never bundle multiple findings into one row
7. **Ratings must match the findings table everywhere they appear** — Executive Summary, Prioritized Actions, and Quick Wins

## Workflow

### Step 1: Build Master Finding List

```
| Section | Item ID | Item Name | Rating |
```

> For the two evidence-only checks (10.1 and 10.3), use the literal Rating value `Evidence-only (see 1.4, 5.5)` and `Evidence-only (see 1.3)` respectively — 10.1's add-on-version evidence is rated under 1.4 and its in-tree-storage evidence under 5.5; 10.3 is rated under 1.3. They contribute no count of any kind (not GREEN/AMBER/RED/N/A/UNKNOWN) to the Maturity Score.

### Step 2: Calculate Maturity Score

- Count GREEN, AMBER, RED, N/A, UNKNOWN
- Calculate percentages (exclude both N/A and UNKNOWN from denominator — N/A means the check does not apply to this cluster). Round each percentage to the nearest whole number; if rounding makes the three (GREEN/AMBER/RED) not sum to 100%, adjust the largest bucket by ±1 so they total 100%. If GREEN+AMBER+RED = 0, render `--` for all three percentages. On a tie for largest bucket, adjust in GREEN→AMBER→RED order.
- **Always render the score line with coverage disclosure** in this form: `Maturity Score: X% (computed over N of M applicable checks; K UNKNOWN excluded)` — where M = applicable checks (GREEN + AMBER + RED + UNKNOWN, i.e. the 36 ratable checks minus N/A), K = the UNKNOWN count, and N = M − K = the checks the score is actually computed over. **X is the GREEN share of the rated checks: `X% = GREEN ÷ N × 100`** (GREEN count divided by N, times 100), rounded to the nearest whole number the same way as the three bucket percentages above (plain rounding — the ±1 sum-to-100 adjustment applies only to the three bucket percentages; on ties the table GREEN% may differ from X by 1). The AMBER-share (`AMBER ÷ N × 100`) and RED-share (`RED ÷ N × 100`) are the other two and are NOT the Maturity Score. If N = 0 (GREEN + AMBER + RED = 0), render the score as `--` (no % sign), consistent with the three percentages. Never present the score without this `(computed over N of M … K UNKNOWN excluded)` annotation. The scoring math is unchanged (N/A and UNKNOWN stay out of the denominator) — this is disclosure, so a high percentage computed over only a handful of checks cannot be mistaken for a healthy cluster. When K = 0, still show the annotation (`computed over M of M applicable checks; 0 UNKNOWN excluded`).

### Step 3: Write Executive Summary

From the master list, identify:
- **Top strengths** (GREEN items with highest operational impact)
- **Top gaps** (RED items, ordered by blast radius: security > availability > cost)
- Write 2-3 paragraphs. Every rating mentioned must match the master list.
- **Coverage caveat (MANDATORY when K UNKNOWN > 0):** whenever any check is UNKNOWN, the Executive Summary must state coverage explicitly — e.g., "This score was computed over N of M applicable checks; K checks could not be assessed (UNKNOWN) and are excluded from the score. The rating reflects only what could be verified." When K exceeds one-third of M (K > M/3), lead with this caveat and explicitly warn that the score is based on limited coverage and must not be read as a clean bill of health — a high percentage over few checks does not indicate a healthy cluster. Point the reader to Items to Investigate Manually.

### Step 4: Write Findings Tables

One table per section. Every item from the master list must appear.

### Step 5: Write Prioritized Actions

Cross-reference against the master list:
- **Critical (30 days):** All RED items except those fixable in < 1 hour, which may instead go in Quick Wins. Column: `Finding | Action | References`
- **Important (90 days):** All AMBER items except those fixable in < 1 hour, which may instead go in Quick Wins. Column: `Finding | Action | References`
- **Quick Wins:** Items (RED or AMBER) fixable in < 1 hour. Column: `[X.X — Item Name] RED/AMBER | Action | Effort | Impact | References`

Every entry must include the finding ID and name (e.g., "4.1 — Control Plane Logging RED"). The rating token may be written as the word RED/AMBER/GREEN or its emoji 🔴/🟡/🟢 — treat the two forms as equal for the Step 8 consistency check, but use one form consistently within a single report.

**One row per finding.** Never bundle multiple findings into a single row (e.g., "2.2/2.3 — GitOps & Drift Detection"). Each finding has its own context, action, and references — collapsing them hides information and breaks the consistency rule that every RED and AMBER must appear in Prioritized Actions. If two findings genuinely share an action, list them on separate rows that point to the same action.

**Ordering within Critical:** List RED items by blast radius category:
1. Security first — public API endpoint, hardcoded credentials, no PSA/network policies, overly broad RBAC
2. Availability next — no PDBs, single-replica critical workloads, missing health probes, no alerting
3. Cost last — extended support billing, deprecated storage classes

Within each category, order by scope (cluster-wide before namespace-scoped).

### Step 6: Write Investigate Manually

All UNKNOWN items with specific questions the user should answer, PLUS any "could-not-verify" caveats from checks capped at AMBER-with-note under the access-denied (403) rule, PLUS manual-review questions surfaced by any check regardless of its rating (GREEN, AMBER, RED, or N/A). A check does not have to be rated UNKNOWN to contribute an item here — a "could not verify X" note on an AMBER-capped check, or a manual-review question raised by a GREEN/N/A check, still belongs in this section.

### Step 7: Apply AWS Reference Links

Use the pre-verified reference map below. Do NOT call the AWS Documentation MCP server — it adds latency and token cost with minimal benefit.

### Step 8: Final Consistency Validation

Before outputting, scan the report for:
- Any RED item missing from Prioritized Actions → add it
- Any AMBER item missing from Prioritized Actions (Important, or Quick Wins if fixable in < 1 hour) → add it
- Any item mentioned in Executive Summary with wrong rating → fix it
- Any Prioritized Action without a finding ID → add the ID
- Any Prioritized Actions row bundling multiple findings → split into one row per finding
- Any Prioritized Actions or Quick Wins row whose rating token differs from that finding's rating in the findings table → fix it
- Verify every "could-not-verify" caveat from an AMBER-with-note capped check, and every manual-review question surfaced by any check, appears in the Items to Investigate Manually section → add any that are missing

### Step 8b: Append Sample-Code Disclaimer

Add the following footer at the very end of the report, after the AWS Reference Links section, separated by a horizontal rule:

```markdown
---

*This report was generated by a Claude Code skill provided as sample code for educational and demonstration purposes only. Findings should be reviewed and validated before acting on them. See the project's README and LICENSE for full terms.*

*Before sharing this report outside your organization, mask or omit the AWS account ID and any cluster ARNs.*
```

### Step 9: Write the Report File

Write the report to the **workspace directory**. The file must be created inside the current workspace.

**Filename format:** `EKS-Operation-Review-<cluster-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHMM>.md`

**Example:** `EKS-Operation-Review-demo-cluster-2026-03-22-1830.md`

The file should be written to the workspace root or a `reports/` subfolder within the workspace. Do NOT use absolute paths outside the workspace.

### Step 10: Offer HTML Conversion

Ask: "Would you like me to convert the report to HTML?"

If yes, run the conversion script — do NOT generate HTML manually. Execute this command:

```bash
python3 tools/report_to_html.py <report-filename>.md
```

From the workspace root, run `python3 tools/report_to_html.py <report>.md`.

Do NOT create HTML by hand. Always use the script.
