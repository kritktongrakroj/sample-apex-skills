# ALB Controller Migration Path

> **Rating model:** Express every finding as **Impact 0–5** using the *Impact Indicator* rubric, weighing three dimensions **in priority order: (1) business logic / revenue — the live traffic at stake · (2) security / reputation · (3) effort to remediate**. **Effort is NOT a severity driver** — a fix being easy or hard never moves the score (it depends on who implements it). **Presence is decided by estate state** — absent controller / empty estate / orphaned dead config = **non-event (0)**; a broken controller is **tech debt (1)** with zero bound routes or a **suspected active outage** (flagged outside the score) with bound routes; a running controller with a **control-plane CVE counts even at zero routes**. See `ingress-discovery.md` for the full presence/stacking rules. Band mapping is a starting point — 🟢 0 / 🟡 1–2 / 🟠 3–4 / 🔴 5 — but the Impact Indicator criteria set the final score (e.g. an easy-to-deploy prerequisite stays 🟡 low even if it blocks a path). All checks are **read-only** (Kubernetes API `get`/`list`, AWS `Describe`/`List`).


## Purpose
Guide migration from NGINX Ingress Controller to AWS Load Balancer Controller (ALB Ingress), converting all NGINX-specific annotations to their ALB equivalents.

> **This is the first hop of the complete path.** After NGINX → **LBC ALB Ingress** (this file), the *second hop* **LBC Ingress → Gateway API** can be automated with the official **`lbc-migrate` toolkit** — see `references/lbc-migrate-toolkit.md`. Full path: NGINX Ingress → LBC ALB Ingress → Gateway API.

## When to Recommend This Path

- Customer wants to stay on Ingress API (not ready for Gateway API)
- Customer needs ALB features (WAF, Cognito/OIDC, Shield)
- Customer has AWS Transform (ATX) access → fully automated migration
- Customer is on Classic Load Balancer via NGINX and wants ALB

## Annotation Mapping: NGINX → ALB

### Core Changes (Every Ingress)

| Step | Before (NGINX) | After (ALB) |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| IngressClass | `ingressClassName: nginx` | `ingressClassName: alb` |
| Deprecated class | `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"` annotation | Remove annotation, add `spec.ingressClassName: alb` |
| Scheme | (implicit: CLB) | `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing` or `internal` |
| Target type | (implicit: NodePort) | `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip` |

### URI Rewrite

| Before (NGINX) | After (ALB) |
|----------------|-------------|
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: "true"` | Remove |
| `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2` | `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/transforms.<svc>` with url-rewrite JSON |
| `path: /something(/\|$)(.*)` + `pathType: ImplementationSpecific` | `path: /something` + `pathType: Prefix` |

**Transforms JSON format:**
```yaml
alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/transforms.<service-name>: |
  [
    {
      "type": "url-rewrite",
      "urlRewriteConfig": {
        "rewrites": [
          {
            "regex": "^\\/something\\/(.*)$",
            "replace": "/$1"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
```

**Rules:**
- **Requires LBC ≥ v2.15.0** — the `transforms.<svc>` annotation was introduced in [v2.15.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/releases/tag/v2.15.0) (2025-11-14). On an older controller it is an unknown annotation and is **silently ignored — no rewrite happens** and traffic reaches the backend with the original path. If the estate needs URI rewrites, the controller floor is **v2.15.0**, not v2.7.2.
- `<service-name>` must match the backend service name in `spec.rules`
- Forward slashes in regex must be escaped as `\\/` in JSON
- NGINX `$2` often becomes ALB `$1` (ALB doesn't need the separator capture group)
- Multi-path Ingress needs separate `transforms.<svc>` per backend service

### TLS / Certificates

| Before (NGINX) | After (ALB) |
|----------------|-------------|
| `spec.tls[].secretName: my-secret` | Remove `spec.tls` section entirely |
| K8s Secret with cert/key | `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: arn:aws:acm:...` |
| Multiple TLS secrets | Comma-separated ARNs, or **omit `certificate-arn`** to let the controller discover ACM certs from the Ingress `tls` hosts / rule `host` values |
| `nginx...ssl-redirect: "true"` | `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "443"` |
| (none) | `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTP": 80}, {"HTTPS": 443}]'` |
| (none) | `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-policy: ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06` |

**Post-migration:** Remove orphaned K8s TLS Secrets that are no longer referenced.

> **Edge termination ≠ done — address the ALB→pod hop (Zero-Trust / compliance).** Moving TLS to ACM edge termination on the ALB and then sending **plaintext HTTP to pods** may **violate organizational/Zero-Trust requirements**, especially on EKS Auto Mode where in-cluster traffic is expected to be encrypted. When recommending edge termination, you MUST state how the ALB→backend hop is protected: e.g. `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: HTTPS` to pods, a `TargetGroupBinding` with HTTPS health/traffic, or a **service mesh (mTLS)**. Never present "terminate at ALB, plaintext to pods" as the finished state without calling out the in-cluster encryption decision.

### Proxy Timeouts

| Before (NGINX) | After (ALB) |
|----------------|-------------|
| `nginx...proxy-read-timeout: "120"` | `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-attributes: idle_timeout.timeout_seconds=120` |
| `nginx...proxy-send-timeout: "120"` | (same — ALB uses single idle timeout) |

### CORS

| Before (NGINX) | After (ALB) |
|----------------|-------------|
| `nginx...enable-cors: "true"` | Remove — handle via AWS WAF or application-level |
| `nginx...cors-allow-origin` | Remove — handle via AWS WAF or application-level |
| `nginx...cors-allow-methods` | Remove — handle via AWS WAF or application-level |
| `nginx...cors-allow-headers` | Remove — handle via AWS WAF or application-level |

**Note:** Add comment in manifest: `# REMOVED: CORS — configure via AWS WAF rules or application middleware`

> **Fidelity gap (not a simple annotation swap):** CORS has **no *faithful* ALB/WAF equivalent for the dynamic case**. ALB *can* inject **static** CORS response headers via listener-rule **response-header** actions (added Nov 2024), which covers a fixed `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`; but **dynamic origin reflection** (echoing the request `Origin` against an allowlist) and **preflight `OPTIONS` short-circuiting** have no native ALB/WAF equivalent and still need the **application backend** (or a Lambda/edge layer). AWS WAF cannot inject CORS response headers at all. NGINX `rate-limit`/`limit-rps` is per-second, per-path/per-client; **AWS WAF rate-based rules** are coarser — they **default to per-IP aggregation** (custom aggregation keys are available) over a configurable **evaluation window (60–600s)**, **cost extra**, and use a completely different config model. Rate these by the **Impact Indicator** and the Feature-Gap classification in `report-generation.md` — by the live traffic/security the lost fidelity affects, **not** by remediation effort (the app/WAF rework is an operator note, never a severity input). Because they lack a faithful equivalent they are **not** trivial swaps, but the band comes from the rubric, not from how much work the change is.

### Authentication

| Before (NGINX) | After (ALB) |
|----------------|-------------|
| `nginx...auth-url` + `nginx...auth-signin` | `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: oidc` |
| (external auth service) | `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-idp-oidc: '{"issuer":"...","authorizationEndpoint":"...","tokenEndpoint":"...","userInfoEndpoint":"...","secretName":"..."}'` |

> **⚠️ Behavior change — NOT a like-for-like conversion.** Basic Auth (`auth-type: basic`, an `Authorization: Basic` header — commonly used by **scripts, cron jobs and machine/API clients**) → ALB **OIDC/Cognito** replaces header auth with an **interactive browser login redirect** to an Identity Provider. Every **non-interactive** caller (automation, CI, partner APIs) **breaks immediately**. This requires client re-architecture (e.g. OIDC client-credentials flow, app-level token auth, or mTLS) and stakeholder coordination — never present `auth-*` → OIDC as a simple annotation swap. **Score it via `report-generation.md` §1.3 as Tier-B** — the faithful workaround is **app-level credential validation** — **escalating to Tier-A (up to 5) only when non-interactive clients are present *and* the backend is a closed/unmodifiable third-party app**, so the credential check cannot be moved into it. Always call out the affected client types.

### Body Size

| Before (NGINX) | After (ALB) |
|----------------|-------------|
| `nginx...proxy-body-size: "50m"` | Remove — no ALB annotation equivalent |

**Note:** Add comment: `# REMOVED: proxy-body-size — configure at application level`

### Access Control / Internal

| Before (NGINX) | After (ALB) |
|----------------|-------------|
| `nginx...whitelist-source-range: "10.0.0.0/8"` | `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internal` |
| (IP restriction) | Use ALB security groups for IP-based access control |

> **Verify before switching internet-facing → internal (High-risk if skipped):**
> 1. **Subnet readiness (read-only):** an internal ALB needs private subnets tagged `kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb` in ≥2 AZs. Check `aws ec2 describe-subnets` for the cluster VPC; if absent, the internal ALB **will fail to provision**. Internet-facing ALBs likewise need `kubernetes.io/role/elb` tags.
> 2. **External-consumer impact:** `whitelist-source-range` on an internet-facing endpoint still served **external** callers (partners, devices, off-cluster clients). Switching to `scheme: internal` makes it reachable **only from inside the VPC** — every external consumer is cut off. Confirm no off-VPC client depends on it, or keep it internet-facing and restrict via `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/inbound-cidrs` / security groups instead. Do not silently convert a public allowlisted endpoint to internal.

### ALB Grouping (Cost Optimization)

To share a single ALB across multiple Ingress resources:
```yaml
alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: shared-alb
alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.order: "10"
```

> **Blast radius — do NOT default to one shared ALB/Gateway across all teams.** Consolidating `team-api`, `team-payments`, `team-web` onto a single shared ALB (or a single Gateway) maximizes blast radius: one team's broken route, bad annotation, or traffic overload degrades **everyone**. Split by **security boundary**, e.g. a `public` group/Gateway for general web and a separate **`private`/payments** group/Gateway for sensitive systems — accept the extra LB cost for isolation. Recommend grouping by trust/security boundary, not "one group to save money." This applies equally to Gateway API: prefer per-boundary `Gateway`s over a single shared listener.

## Migration Phases (ALB Path)

### Phase 1: Prerequisites
1. Install AWS Load Balancer Controller — **v2.7.2+** for the ALB Ingress path, **v2.15.0+** if any route needs a `transforms` URI rewrite (see Rewrites above)
2. Provision ACM certificates for all TLS hosts
3. Ensure IAM roles/policies for LB Controller

### Phase 2: Convert Manifests
1. Apply annotation mapping (above) to each Ingress
2. Use ATX for automated conversion (if available) — see `references/atx-guide.md`
3. Validate with `kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f <file>`

### Phase 3: Deploy & Shift Traffic
1. Deploy migrated Ingress (creates new ALB)
2. Use DNS weighted routing to shift traffic CLB→ALB
3. Monitor error rates, latency

### Phase 4: Cleanup
1. Delete old NGINX Ingress resources
2. Remove NGINX Ingress Controller deployment
3. Remove orphaned TLS Secrets
4. Update IaC/GitOps references

## Checks to Execute

### ALB.1 — Annotation Conversion Completeness

**What to check:**
- All `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/*` annotations identified
- Each has a mapped ALB equivalent or documented removal reason

**Impact (per Impact Indicator):**
- 🟡 1–2 (Low): Only mechanical changes (class swap on the *same* controller, scheme/target-type, simple path) — but see the cutover note below.
- 🟠 3–4 (Medium): URI rewrites → `transforms`, TLS → ACM, timeouts; plus the **new-ALB + DNS cutover** every class switch incurs.
- 🔴 5 (High), no workaround (Tier-A): `configuration-snippet`/`server-snippet` (and the other no-equivalent features — Lua, mirror-to-arbitrary-backend, regex rewrite with capture groups, TLS passthrough, mTLS client-cert). These need **application/code changes** and raise the Re-architecture Gate.
- **Tier-B — score via the rubric, NOT automatically 🔴 5:** **CORS, rate-limit, IP-allowlist, Basic Auth → OIDC** have a faithful workaround (app/backend layer, or WAF / Security Group), so they are rated per the `report-generation.md` §1.3 Feature-Gap rubric — **Impact 2–3 while that workaround can be applied**, escalating to Tier-A (up to 5) only when it cannot (a closed/unmodifiable backend whose loss degrades a live business flow). For **Basic Auth → OIDC** the escalation additionally requires **non-interactive clients** — where every caller is a browser, ALB OIDC/Cognito is a faithful substitute. `report-generation.md` §1.3 is the source of truth for their score.
- ⬜ Unknown: Cannot parse annotations

> **Cutover note (applies to EVERY nginx→alb conversion):** switching `ingressClassName: nginx → alb` is a **cross-controller** change — the AWS LB Controller provisions a **new ALB**, and **traffic does not move until DNS is cut over** to it. This is a parallel-run + DNS cutover, **never** a zero-impact file edit. Therefore a bare class switch is **at least Medium**, even when the YAML diff is one line. (Changing the deprecated `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation to `spec.ingressClassName` on the **same** class is the only genuinely Low case.)

### ALB.2 — ACM Certificate Readiness

**What to check:**
- All TLS hosts have matching ACM certificates (or rely on certificate discovery by omitting `certificate-arn`)
- Certificates are in ISSUED state in the correct region

**Impact (per Impact Indicator):**
- 🟡 1–2 (Low): All certs available in ACM
- 🟠 3–4 (Medium): Some certs need provisioning
- 🔴 5 (High): Certs use private CA or non-standard issuance
- ⬜ Unknown: Cannot check ACM

### ALB.3 — AWS LB Controller Readiness

**What to check:**
- AWS LB Controller installed and version **≥ v2.7.2** (**≥ v2.15.0** if `transforms` URI rewrites are used)
- IAM role with correct policy attached
- IngressClass `alb` exists

**Impact (per Impact Indicator):**
- 🟡 1–2 (Low): Controller installed, correct version, IAM ready
- 🟠 3–4 (Medium): Controller present but needs upgrade
- 🔴 5 (High): Controller not installed
- ⬜ Unknown: Cannot determine
