# Migration Risk Assessment

> **Rating model:** Express every finding as **Impact 0–5** using the *Impact Indicator* rubric, weighing three dimensions **in priority order: (1) business logic / revenue — the live traffic at stake · (2) security / reputation · (3) effort to remediate**. **Effort is NOT a severity driver** — a fix being easy or hard never moves the score (it depends on who implements it). **Presence is decided by estate state** — absent controller / empty estate / orphaned dead config = **non-event (0)**; a broken controller is **tech debt (1)** with zero bound routes or a **suspected active outage** (flagged outside the score) with bound routes; a running controller with a **control-plane CVE counts even at zero routes**. See `ingress-discovery.md` for the full presence/stacking rules. Band mapping is a starting point — 🟢 0 / 🟡 1–2 / 🟠 3–4 / 🔴 5 — but the Impact Indicator criteria set the final score (e.g. an easy-to-deploy prerequisite stays 🟡 low even if it blocks a path). All checks are **read-only** (Kubernetes API `get`/`list`, AWS `Describe`/`List`).


## Purpose
Evaluate risk of migrating from Ingress to Gateway API.

## Checks to Execute

### 6.1 — Downtime Risk

**What to check:**
- Can Ingress and Gateway API coexist during migration? (yes — different resource types)
- DNS cutover strategy (weighted DNS, blue-green, or instant switch)
- DNS TTL values

**How to check:**
1. Confirm Ingress resources and HTTPRoute resources can coexist (they can — different API groups)
2. Check external-dns configuration for TTL
3. Count active Ingress resources (migration scope)

**Key insight (and its limits):** Ingress and the new Gateway/ALB resources can *exist* side by side in the cluster — but **coexistence in the cluster ≠ safe gradual traffic shift.** NGINX usually sits behind a Classic/Network Load Balancer (L4); the target is a **new L7 ALB with a different DNS name**. You can only do weighted/gradual DNS shifting if the fronting DNS/LB architecture supports it. If it doesn't, the cutover is effectively **all-or-nothing**, or relies on **very low DNS TTLs** with real risk of **stale-DNS traffic hanging** on the old endpoint. Do **not** rate downtime Low merely because the two resource types can coexist.

**Also check:** does a weighted/blue-green path actually exist (Route 53 weighted records / a shared front door), and what are the current DNS TTLs? If neither, flag the cutover as higher risk.

**Impact (per Impact Indicator):**
- 🟡 1–2 (Low): A real gradual-shift path exists (e.g. Route 53 weighted records or shared front door) **and** DNS automation/low TTL is in place.
- 🟠 3–4 (Medium): Cross-architecture cutover (NGINX/L4 → new L7 ALB) with no proven weighted-shift path — plan a tight, low-TTL cutover window; partial-outage risk.
- 🔴 5 (High): All-or-nothing cutover, no DNS automation, high TTLs, or business-critical hosts — manual DNS changes risk real downtime.
- ⬜ Unknown: Cannot assess DNS/front-door architecture.

### 6.2 — Feature Gap Analysis

**What to check:**
- Features used in current Ingress that have no Gateway API equivalent
- Workarounds available via AWS services

**How to check:**
1. Compile annotation inventory from Section 3
2. Map each to Gateway API equivalent or workaround:
   - nginx rate limiting → AWS WAF rate-based rules
   - nginx basic auth → ALB + Cognito/OIDC (Gateway annotation) — **browser callers only**; non-interactive clients break (see `alb-migration.md` Authentication)
   - nginx custom error pages → CloudFront custom error responses
   - nginx modsecurity → AWS WAF managed rules
   - nginx configuration-snippet → ❌ No equivalent (redesign)
   - nginx server-snippet → ❌ No equivalent (redesign)

**Impact (per Impact Indicator):**
- 🟡 1–2 (Low): All features have Gateway API or AWS service equivalents
- 🟠 3–4 (Medium): Some features need AWS service substitution
- 🔴 5 (High): Critical dependency on features with no equivalent — architecture redesign needed
- ⬜ Unknown: Cannot determine feature gap

### 6.3 — Rollback Readiness

**What to check:**
- Old Ingress resources preserved during migration (don't delete until validated)
- Ingress resources version-controlled (Git)
- GitOps rollback available (ArgoCD/Flux)
- **Session affinity / stateful routing** — any Ingress using `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: cookie` (sticky sessions) or otherwise relying on connection/session state.

**How to check:**
1. Confirm old Ingress resources will be kept (not deleted)
2. Check workspace for IaC files managing Ingress resources
3. Check for ArgoCD/Flux managing Ingress resources
4. Scan for `affinity: cookie` / `session-cookie-*` annotations (e.g. `legacy-mirror-sticky`).

> **Sticky sessions break the rollback story.** GitOps revert is not a clean rollback for **stateful/sticky** ingresses: NGINX affinity cookies do not carry to an ALB (ALB uses its own `AWSALB`/`AWSALBCORS` cookie), so switching NGINX↔ALB — including a **rollback** — **drops every in-flight logged-in session**, a direct business impact. The architect must **externalize session state (e.g. Redis/central session store) before** the Ingress migration so traffic can move either direction without dropping users. Flag any sticky-session Ingress as a rollback-readiness risk and require a session-handling plan; rate it Medium+ accordingly.

**Impact (per Impact Indicator):**
- 🟡 1–2 (Low): Ingress resources in Git, GitOps managed, rollback = revert HTTPRoute + keep Ingress
- 🟠 3–4 (Medium): Ingress resources in Git but no GitOps
- 🔴 5 (High): Ingress resources not in version control
- ⬜ Unknown: Cannot determine rollback readiness
